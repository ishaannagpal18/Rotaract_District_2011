                  <p style="font-size: 1rem;" class="u-custom-item u-text u-text-5">Service Above Self is Rotaryâ€™s greatest guiding principle.<br>
The districts' projects are designed to improve the quality of life of others whilst promoting peace through their social service nature. The district works in addressing the most critical issues that persist in the society like violence, drug abuse, AIDS, hunger, climate, and illiteracy.<br>
These steps also train them to create and maintain powerful clubs with relevant service projects and work towards maintaining an ethical and youth-friendly environment thereby working towards a greater good. The district also takes great pride in its awareness and relations to international affairs which in turn helps in establishing harmony all around the world.

                  <p style="font-size: 1rem;" class="u-custom-item u-text u-text-9">The district's vision in this Rota Year aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations and aims at nurturing the changemakers of society. The District Rotaract Representative of RID 3011 believes that while we delve into the achievement of the SDGs, alongside it is impeccably vital to nurture those leaders who can work towards achieving these goals, the ones who hone the skills to build a world where there are fewer obstructions for people, and rather more harmony and kindness. Thereby, his main emphasis is to see a better future through the lens of today's young tender minds. Through the auspicious platform of Rotaract, he aspires to echo the Rotary's Areas of Focus in action through young leaders of the community.<br>
